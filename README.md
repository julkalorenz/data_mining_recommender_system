### Description
**Movie Recommender System**  is an innovative project aimed at enhancing user experience by predicting movie ratings based on individual preferences. Leveraging a dataset containing diverse movie attributes and user ratings, the project employs advanced machine learning techniques to develop a predictive model.

The culmination of this endeavor is encapsulated in a detailed report, documenting the methodology, findings, and insights gained throughout the project's lifecycle.

Additionally, a scientist poster succinctly summarizes the key aspects of the project, serving as a visual aid to communicate its objectives, methodologies, and outcomes effectively.

### Dataset
The dataset utilized for training the predictive model is readily available through a provided link.

### How to use jupyter notebook

#### Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

* Python: Jupyter Notebook requires Python (3.11.7). You can download and install Python from the official website: [Python.org.](https://www.python.org/)
* pip (Python package installer): You can install pip by following the instructions provided [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

#### Necessary Libraries

Before running the Jupyter Notebook, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **numpy** *1.25.2*: A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python. It provides support for arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions.

  ```bash
  pip install numpy
  ```
- **pandas** *2.1.4*: A powerful data manipulation and analysis library. It provides data structures and functions for efficiently working with structured data.
    ```bash
    pip install pandas
    ```
- **scikit-learn** *1.2.2*: A machine learning library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
    ```bash
    pip install scikit-learn
    ```
- **matplotlib** *3.8.0*: A comprehensive library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python. It is commonly used for data visualization tasks.
    ```bash
    pip install matplotlib
    ```
- **seaborn** *0.12.2*: A statistical data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
    ```bash
    pip install seaborn
    ```

#### Opening Jupyter Notebook
Before launching the Jupyter Notebook, ensure you have it installed on your system. If you haven't installed Jupyter Notebook yet, you can do so by following the instructions provided on the [official Jupyter website](https://jupyter.org/).

To open Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to work with Jupyter Notebook using the cd command. For example:
    ```bash
    cd path/to/your/directory
    ```
3. Once you're in the desired directory, run the following command to start Jupyter Notebook
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```
4. After running the command, your default web browser should open automatically, displaying the Jupyter Notebook dashboard.
5. In the Jupyter Notebook dashboard, navigate to the directory where your notebook is located.
6. Click on the name of the notebook file to open it. Alternatively, you can use the search bar at the top to search for the notebook file by name.
